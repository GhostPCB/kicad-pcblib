kicad-ipcpcb
============

Generate KiCad libraries from the FreePCB IPC libraries.

Requires Make, Python, and the sexpdata Python module. Clone this repository
and run 'make'; the makefile will download the FreePCB IPC libraries and
convert them to KiCad .pretty libs. Note that I am not distributing the FreePCB
libraries, but I could (as they're covered by GPL); if they ever become
unavailable I will add them here.
